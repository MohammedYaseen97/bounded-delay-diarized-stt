## Reading tracker (Week 0–6)

This folder is where you track reading with short, high-signal notes.

Rules:
- Keep notes brief (1–2 pages/week max).
- Write in your own words.
- Focus on what you’ll *use* in the next week’s implementation.

How it connects:
- Each `assignments/weekN_*.md` includes a **Reading** checklist that prepares **Week N+1**.
- Use `scripts/check_reading.py --week N` to sanity-check that your notes are filled.
